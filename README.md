# Threads
## Third assigment in Operating System course
The original code was taken from https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#a-simple-stream-server

We needed to make the server be able to support multiple clients using threads insted of fork().

## Running Programm:
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MightyArty/Threads.git
# Go into the repository
# Open two or more terminals
# One for the server, the others for the clients
$ Run "make"
$ Run "./server"
$ Run "./client"
```
